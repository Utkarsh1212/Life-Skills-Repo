# Tiny Habits

### Question 1: What was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea in the video is the concept of how small, consistent habits can lead to significant, long-term success. It emphasizes focusing on systems and daily actions rather than just goals. This shift in perspective can make personal growth and achievements more sustainable and rewarding.

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

The B = MAP formula comes from BJ Fogg's behavioral model and stands for:

- **B**: Behavior (the habit or action you want to perform)
- **M**: Motivation (your desire to perform the behavior)
- **A**: Ability (your capacity to perform the behavior, considering ease or difficulty)
- **P**: Prompt (a trigger or cue that reminds you to perform the behavior)

Example: Building a Reading Habit

- **B**: Reading 1 page of a book daily.
- **M**: Remind yourself of the joy of learning or relaxing through books.
- **A**: Keep the book where you can easily access it, like on your bedside table.
- **P**: Pair reading with an existing routine, like drinking coffee in the morning.

By ensuring all three (M, A, and P) align, the habit becomes easier to start and sustain.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?

Celebrating a habit makes you feel good, and your brain connects that good feeling with the habit. This makes you want to do it again. A small celebration, like smiling or saying, "I did it!", helps turn actions into lasting habits.

**Key Idea**: Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit because emotions drive habit formation, not just repetition.

### Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

The most interesting idea from James Clear’s talk is the concept of getting just 1% better every day. He explains how small, consistent improvements, when compounded over time, lead to huge changes and success. It shows that big results don’t come from major efforts all at once, but from consistent, small actions over time.

### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

The book says that your identity is important in building habits. If you think of yourself as the kind of person who does the habit, you’re more likely to keep doing it. For example, instead of saying "I want to exercise," say "I am an active person." It helps you stick with it.

### Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do.

To make a habit easier, the book suggests:
- Make it simple and convenient.
- Break it into small steps.
- Start small, like doing a habit for just two minutes to get started.

### Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do.

To make a habit harder, the book suggests:
- Make it more difficult to start by adding extra steps or removing easy access.
- For example, hide junk food or put your phone in another room to make it harder to use.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious, or the habit more attractive, or easy, and/or the response satisfying?

A habit that I want to do more of is deep work or focused study sessions (working on concentration and time management).

- **Make the cue obvious**: Set a specific time and place for studying, like "I study every morning at my desk."
- **Make it attractive**: Pair the habit with something enjoyable, like listening to calming music or rewarding yourself after completing a study session.
- **Make it easy**: Break your study sessions into smaller chunks and start with just 25 minutes of focused work.
- **Make it satisfying**: Celebrate small wins after completing tasks or reflect on your progress, which will reinforce the habit.

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of. What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible, or the process unattractive, or hard, or the response unsatisfying?

A habit that I want to do less of could be checking my phone or social media during study sessions.

- **Make the cue invisible**: Put your phone in another room or use a “Do Not Disturb” mode during study time.
- **Make it unattractive**: Remind yourself of how much time it wastes or how distracted you feel afterward.
- **Make it hard**: Use apps or settings that block social media or distracting apps during study hours.
- **Make the response unsatisfying**: If you check your phone, you can create a small penalty, like doing 10 push-ups for each distraction.
