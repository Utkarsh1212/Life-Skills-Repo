### **Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day-to-day life?**

**Answer**:  
I tend to switch to a passive communication style when I want to avoid conflict or when I feel that my opinions might upset someone. For example, in situations where I might disagree with someone but don’t want to create tension, I might stay quiet or agree with their point even if I don’t fully agree.

### **Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day-to-day life?**

**Answer**:  
I might switch to aggressive communication when I feel frustrated or when someone crosses my boundaries. For instance, if I feel overwhelmed by someone’s behavior or disregard for my time, I may react in a way that feels confrontational or intense, such as raising my voice or expressing anger.

### **Question 7: When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day-to-day life?**

**Answer**:  
I switch into passive-aggressive communication when I feel unable to express my true feelings directly, usually because of fear of conflict or not feeling heard. For example, I might use sarcasm to hint at my displeasure or give the silent treatment when I’m upset but don’t feel comfortable addressing the issue directly.

### **Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?**

**Answer**:  
To make my communication more assertive, I could apply several strategies learned from the videos:  
- **Use "I" statements**: For example, “I feel frustrated when…” rather than blaming or accusing others.  
- **Set clear boundaries**: Clearly expressing what is acceptable and what is not, without being rude or disrespectful.  
- **Be honest but respectful**: Expressing my thoughts openly while considering the feelings of others.  
- **Practice active listening**: Listening to others fully and responding thoughtfully.  
- **Stay calm**: When I feel emotional, taking a moment to gather my thoughts before speaking, rather than reacting impulsively.  
- **Speak with confidence**: Ensuring that my tone is steady, my body language is open, and I stand firm in my beliefs while remaining empathetic to others’ perspectives.
